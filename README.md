# Skykingdom Project

This repo was created to document the work put into the Skykingdom project. The actual repo needs to remain private, to ensure code isn't stolen. So I've described the work I am doing in detail here.

**What is Skykingdom?**

*Skykingdom is a multi-year long game development project, that aims to create a unique new gamemode for Minecraft Bedrock Edition. The project uses PHP, and the Minecraft server hosting api Pocketmine. All of the code in this project, is based off the PMMP (Pocketmine) software, and will not work stand alone.*


**What type of work does this involve?**  

  Game design
  
  - *Designing the mechanics of the game to ensure the best experience for the player. And also to ensure that players remain interested and continue playing the game, after it is no longer as populer.*
  
  Server-side Developement
  
  - *Contrary to popular belief Minecraft servers handle all parts of gameplay server-side, rather than client side, this means that instead of the user downloading mod packs, the server software Pocketmine, handles all of the game logic, and acts as a middle man, creating space for moddificition for new game-modes, features, etc. Server-side development includes: writing scalable code, creating modules to process incoming packets, create packets to efficiently store, process, and retrieve player data and game data, utilizing pocketmine event listeners, coding extensive error handling and validation checks, and testing code.*
  
  UI And Game Level Design
  
  - *In typical level and UI design, your only limits are the engine you use to create the game. But we we're limited by the game we're modifying. In order to create the highest   level of quality for the players, we had to create unique soliutions. This required lots of engenuity and problem solving skills.*
  
  AntiCheat / Security
  - *Due to high number of cheating software available for Minecraft, a good anti-cheat is core to a good Minecraft server. This requires creating algorithms that process incoming packets from players and check for deviation from what that packet should look like.*
  
  And of course we had to manage community forums, marketing, and all of the non-development responsibilites that come with making something like this.
