**Skykingdom Project**

This repo was created to document the amount of work put into the Skykingdom project. The actual repo needs to remain private, to ensure code isn't stolen. So I've taken screenshot and snippits of different parts of the project to show off the work.

*What is Skykingdom?*  
Skykingdom is a multi-year long game development project, that aims to create a unique new gamemode for Minecraft Bedrock Edition. The project uses PHP, and the Minecraft server hosting server Pocketmine. All of the code in this project, is based off the PMMP (Pocketmine) software, and will not work stand alone.


*What type of work does this involve?*  
Because this entirely new gamemode, some of the different aspects of this project we're: 
  - Game design  
  Designing the mechanics of the game to ensure the best experience for the play. And also to ensure that players remain interested and continue playing the game, after it is no   longer hyped up or trending.  
  - Server-side Developement
  Much of Minecraft gameplay is actually handled server-side, rather than client side, this means that instead of the user downloading mod packs, the server software Pocketmine,   handles all of the game logic, and acts as a middle man, creating space for moddificition for new game-modes, features, etc, that don't already exist in the game. Server-side development includes: storing player data and game data, utilizing pocketmine event listeners, handling events, creating visual.
  - UI And Game Level Design
  In typical level and UI design, your only limits are the engine you use to create the game. But we we're limited by the game we we're modifying. In order to create the highest   level of quality for the players, we had to create unique soliutions. This required lots of engenuity and problem solving skills.
  - AntiCheat / Security
  Due to high number of cheating software available for Minecraft, a good anti-cheat is core to a good Minecraft server. This requires working with raw packet data, and is very   difficult.
  
  And there are so many more aspects to this project.
